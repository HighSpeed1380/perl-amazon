#   CGIProxy 2.1.17
#
#   CGIProxy (nph-proxy.cgi): a proxy in the form of a CGI script.
#     Retrieves the resource at any HTTP or FTP URL, updating embedded URLs
#     in HTML and all other resources to point back through this script.  By
#     default, no user info is sent to the server.  Options include
#     text-only proxying to save bandwidth, cookie filtering, ad filtering,
#     script removal, user-defined encoding of the target URL, and much more.
#     Besides running as a CGI script, can also run under mod_perl, as a
#     FastCGI script, or can use its own embedded HTTP server.
#     Requires Perl 5.

#
#   IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT ANONYMOUS BROWSING:
#
#     CGIProxy was originally made for indirect browsing more than
#       anonymity, but since people are using it for anonymity, I've tried
#       to make it as anonymous as possible.  Suggestions welcome.  For best
#       anonymity, browse with JavaScript turned off.  That said, please notify
#       me if you find any privacy holes, even when using JavaScript.
#     Anonymity is good, but may not be bulletproof.  For example, if even
#       a single unchecked JavaScript statement can be run, your anonymity
#       can be compromised.  I've tried to handle JS in every place it can
#       exist, but please tell me if I missed any.  Also, browser plugins
#       or other executable extensions may be able to reveal you to a server.
#       Also, be aware that this script doesn't modify PDF files or other
#       third-party document formats that may contain linking ability, so
#       you will lose your anonymity if you follow links in such files.
#     If you find any other way your anonymity can be compromised, please let
#       me know.
#
#
#   INSTALLATION:
#
#     First, edit this file (nph-proxy.cgi) to configure it-- see the CONFIGURATION
#       section just below for certain options that may be required.  All
#       configuration variables are set in the "user configuration" section starting
#       around line 338.
#     After copying nph-proxy.cgi to your server, run "./nph-proxy.cgi init"
#       from the server command line (on Windows, run "perl nph-proxy.cgi init").
#       This creates needed directories, installs all optional Perl (CPAN) modules,
#       and creates the database that CGIProxy uses.  Ignore the scrolling text,
#       and hit <return> if asked any questions.  Ideally you can run this command
#       as root to set file permissions and ownership optimally, but even if run as
#       non-root these will be handled as well as possible and the script should
#       still work.
#     To see a simple usage message, run "./nph-proxy.cgi -?".
#     It's fine to rename this file, as long as your Web server is set up to
#       recognize it.  All of the documentation refers to "nph-proxy.cgi",
#       but replace that with whatever you renamed the file to.
#
#     For complete installation instructions, see
#       https://jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/install.html
#
#
#   CONFIGURATION:
#
#     . Set $PROXY_DIR and $RUN_AS_USER -- see the comments above those settings
#         for details.
#     . If you don't have root access on your server, set $LOCAL_LIB_DIR so that
#         the Perl (CPAN) modules can be installed under your own directory.  Do
#         this before running "./nph-proxy.cgi init", as described above.
#     . If you're using either a MySQL/MariaDB or Oracle database to store cookies,
#         you need to set $DB_DRIVER, $DB_USER, $DB_PASS, and possibly $DB_SERVER .
#         See the notes by those settings for more details.  Note that you need to
#         purge the database periodically by running "./nph-proxy.cgi purge-db",
#         with a cron job on Unix or Mac, or with the Task Scheduler in Windows.
#         The default database driver is SQLite, which doesn't need a username or
#         password or even a running database engine, but still requires periodic
#         purging.
#     . If you're using another HTTP or SSL proxy, set $HTTP_PROXY,
#         $SSL_PROXY, and $NO_PROXY as needed.  If those proxies use
#         authentication, set $PROXY_AUTH and $SSL_PROXY_AUTH accordingly.
#     . If you're using a SOCKS proxy, set $SOCKS_PROXY and possibly
#         $SOCKS_USERNAME and $SOCKS_PASSWORD .
#     . If this is running on an insecure server that doesn't use port 80, set
#         $RUNNING_ON_SSL_SERVER=0 (otherwise, the default of '' is fine).
#     . If you plan to run CGIProxy as a FastCGI script, set at least
#         $SECRET_PATH and see the configuration section "FastCGI configuration".
#     . If you plan to run CGIProxy using its own embedded server, set
#         $SECRET_PATH and see the configuration section "Embedded server configuration".
#         You'll also need a certificate and private key (key pair) in PEM
#         format.
#     . See http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/options.html#env , in the section
#         "OPTIONS RELATED TO YOUR SERVER/NETWORK ENVIRONMENT", for other options
#         you may need to set.
#
#     Other options include:
#       . Set $TEXT_ONLY, $REMOVE_COOKIES, $REMOVE_SCRIPTS, $FILTER_ADS,
#           $HIDE_REFERER, and $INSERT_ENTRY_FORM as desired.  Set
#           $REMOVE_SCRIPTS if anonymity is important.
#       . To let the user choose all of those settings (except $TEXT_ONLY),
#           set $ALLOW_USER_CONFIG=1.
#       . To change the encoding format of the URL, modify the
#           proxy_encode() and proxy_decode() routines.  The default
#           routines are suitable for simple PATH_INFO compliance.
#       . To encode cookies, modify the cookie_encode() and cookie_decode()
#           routines.
#       . You can restrict which servers this proxy will access, with
#           @ALLOWED_SERVERS and @BANNED_SERVERS.
#       . Similarly, you can specify allowed and denied server lists for
#           both cookies and scripts.
#       . For security, you can ban access to private IP ranges, with
#           @BANNED_NETWORKS.
#       . If filtering ads, you can customize this with a few settings.
#       . To insert your own block of HTML into each page, set $INSERT_HTML
#           or $INSERT_FILE.
#       . As a last resort, if you really can't run this script as NPH,
#           you can try to run it as non-NPH by setting $NOT_RUNNING_AS_NPH=1.
#           BUT, read the notes and warnings above that line.  Caveat surfor.
#       . For crude load-balancing among a set of proxies, set @PROXY_GROUP.
#       . Other config is possible; see the user configuration section.
#       . If heavy use of this proxy puts a load on your server, see the
#           "NOTES ON PERFORMANCE" section below.
#
#     For more info, read the comments above any config options you set.
#
#     For a full list of options, see https://jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/options.html
#
#     This script MUST be installed as a non-parsed header (NPH) script.
#       In Apache and many other servers, this is done by simply starting the
#       filename with "nph-".  It MAY be possible to fake it as a non-NPH
#       script, MOST of the time, by using the $NOT_RUNNING_AS_NPH feature.
#       This is not advised.  See the comments by that option for warnings.
#
#
#   TO USE:
#     Start a browsing session by visiting the script's URL with no parameters.
#       You can bookmark pages you browse to through the proxy, or link to
#       the URLs that are generated.
#
#
#   NOTES ON PERFORMANCE:
#     Unfortunately, this has gotten slower through the versions, mostly
#       because of optional new features.  Configured equally, version 1.3
#       takes 25% longer to run than 1.0 or 1.1 (based on *cough* highly
#       abbreviated testing).  Compiling takes about 50% longer.
#     Leaving $REMOVE_SCRIPTS=1 adds 25-50% to the running time.
#     Remember that we're talking about tenths of a second here.  Most of
#       the delay experienced by the user is from waiting on two network
#       connections.  These performance issues only matter if your server
#       CPU is getting overloaded.  Also, these mostly matter when retrieving
#       JavaScript and Flash, because modifying those is what takes most of the
#       time.
#     If you can, use mod_perl.  Starting with version 1.3.1, this should
#       work under mod_perl, which requires Perl 5.004 or later.  If you use
#       mod_perl, be careful to install this as an NPH script, i.e. set the
#       "PerlSendHeader Off" configuration directive (or "PerlOptions -ParseHeaders"
#       if using mod_perl 2.x).  For more info, see the mod_perl documentation.
#     If you can't use mod_perl, try using FastCGI.  Configure the section
#       "FastCGI configuration" below, and run nph-proxy.cgi from the command
#       line to see a usage message.  You'll also need to configure your
#       Web server to use FastCGI.
#     If you can't use mod_perl or FastCGI, try running CGIProxy as its own
#       embedded server.  Configure the section "Embedded server configuration",
#       and run nph-proxy.cgi from the command line to see a usage message.
#       You'll also need a key pair (certificate and private key).
#     If you use mod_perl, FastCGI, or the embedded server, and modify this
#       script, see the note near the "reset 'a-z'" line below, regarding
#       UPPER_CASE and lower_case variable names.
#
#     If performance on the browser is bad for JS-heavy sites like facebook,
#       then close other browser windows and other CPU-heavy processes, and
#       see the comments above the setting of %REDIRECTS below.  Also, try
#       using a browser other than MSIE-- it seems to have the most problems.
#
#
#   TO DO:
#     What I want to hear about:
#       . Any HTML tags not being converted here.
#       . Any method of introducing JavaScript or other script, that's not
#           being handled here.
#       . Any script MIME types other than those already in @SCRIPT_MIME_TYPES.
#       . Any MIME types other than text/html that have links that need to
#           be converted.
#     plug any other script holes (e.g. MSIE-proprietary, other MIME types?)
#     more error checking?
#     find a simple encryption technique for proxy_encode()
#     For ad filtering, add option to disable images from servers other than
#       that of the containing HTML page?  Is it worth it?
#
#
#   BUGS:
#     Anonymity may not not perfect.  In particular, there may be some remaining
#       JavaScript or Flash holes.  Please let me know if you find any.
#     Since ALL of your cookies are sent to this script (which then chooses
#       the relevant ones), some cookies could be dropped if you accumulate a
#       lot, resulting in "Bad Request" errors.  To fix this, use a database
#       server for cookies.
#
#
#   I first wrote this in 1996 as an experiment to allow indirect browsing.
#     The original seed was a program I wrote for Rich Morin's article
#     in the June 1996 issue of Unix Review, online at
#     http://www.cfcl.com/tin/P/199606.shtml.
#
#   Confession: I didn't originally write this with the spec for HTTP
#     proxies in mind, and there are probably some violations of the protocol
#     (at least for proxies).  This whole thing is one big violation of the
#     proxy model anyway, so I hereby rationalize that the spec can be widely
#     interpreted here.  If there is demand, I can make it more conformant.
#     The HTTP client and server components should be fine; it's just the
#     special requirements for proxies that may not be followed.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#    user configuration
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# For certain purposes, CGIProxy may need to create files.  This is where
#   those will go.  For example, use "/home/username/cgiproxy", where "username"
#   is replaced by your username.
# This directory has to be readable and writeable by the userID that CGIProxy
#   runs as; that userID is set in the Web server configuration (if this is running
#   as a CGI script or under mod_perl), or else it's the userID used to start
#   the FastCGI server or the embedded server.
# This can be either a relative or absolute path.  If it's a relative path, it
#   will be interpreted relative to the home directory of this script file's owner.
# If you have root access and can run "./nph-proxy init" as root (which has
#   advantages), then set this to an absolute path so it doesn't go under
#   the /root directory.
# Note that you need to use "\\" to represent a single backslash.
# Leading drive letters (e.g. for Windows) are allowed.
# The default will use the directory "cgiproxy" under your home directory (which
#   varies with your operating system).  If it doesn't work, manually set
#   $PROXY_DIR to an absolute path.  You can name it whatever you want.
# Also see $RUN_AS_USER, just below.  Note that many special users, probably
#   including your Web server's user, don't have a home directory to put $PROXY_DIR
#   under.  For such a case, you need to set $PROXY_DIR to another directory somewhere
#   that the Web server's user can read and write.
# Note that in Unix or Mac, using a directory on a mounted filesystem (which often
#   includes home directories) may prevent that filesystem from being unmounted,
#   which may bother your sysadmin.  If so, try setting this to something starting
#   with "/tmp/", like "/tmp/.your-username/".
# If you get "mkdir" permission errors, create the directory yourself with mkdir.
#   You may also need to "chmod 777 directoryname" to make the directory writable
#   by the Web server, but note that this makes it readable and writable by
#   everybody.  You might ask your webmaster if they provide a safe way for CGI
#   scripts to read and write files in your directories.  With Apache, the suEXEC
#   feature is often used to let multiple website owners use the same server
#   securely: each CGI or mod_perl script is run as the owner of the script file.
$PROXY_DIR= 'cgiproxy' ;


# If you have root access and can run "./nph-proxy init" as root, then set this
#   to either the username or numeric user ID that the script will run as.  When
#   run as a CGI script or under mod_perl, this is usually the Web server's
#   username, or possibly the script owner's username if using Apache with the
#   suEXEC feature turned on.
# Setting this lets "./nph-proxy init" create the needed directories ($PROXY_DIR
#   and subdirectories) and a SQLite database file (if using SQLite) with the right
#   permissions and ownership.
# If you run this script as the root user in order to use port 443 with the
#   embedded server, it's a good idea to change the user ID to something with
#   fewer permissions.  You can also do this by setting $RUN_AS_USER .
# In any case, this has to be set to an existing user on the server, i.e. CGIProxy
#   doesn't create the user if it doesn't already exist.
# If this is not set, it will default to the owner of this script file.
# Also see $PROXY_DIR, just above.  Note that many special users, probably including
#   your Web server's user, don't have a home directory to put $PROXY_DIR under.
#   For such a case, you need to set $PROXY_DIR to another directory somewhere that
#   the Web server's user can read and write.
# This probably won't work on Windows, though note that you don't need root
#   access to use port 443 on Windows.
#$RUN_AS_USER= 'nobody' ;


# IMPORTANT:  CHANGE THIS IF USING FASTCGI OR THE EMBEDDED SERVER!
# If using FastCGI or the embedded server, the path in the URL will begin with a
#   fixed alphanumeric sequence (string) to help conceal the proxy.  You can set
#   this to any alphanumeric string.  The URL of your proxy will be
#   "https://example.com/secret" (replace "secret" with your actual secret).
# If we didn't do this, then a censor could check if a site hosts a proxy by
#   merely accessing "https://example.com" .
# Note that this is not a secret from the users, just from anyone watching
#   network traffic.  Also, it won't be kept secret if your server is insecure.
$SECRET_PATH= 'secret' ;


# If you don't have root access on your server, set this so that Perl (CPAN)
#   modules are installed under your own directory.  Be sure to follow the
#   instructions about the environment variables after you run "./nph-proxy.cgi init".
# If this script is not running as your user ID (such as a Web server running
#   as its own user ID), and you're using the local::lib module, then 
#   set this to the directory where your modules are installed with local::lib .
#   This is normally just the "perl5" directory under your home directory, unless
#   you renamed it or configured local::lib to use a different directory.
# If you set this before installing modules, then CPAN (Perl) modules will be
#   installed into this directory.
#$LOCAL_LIB_DIR= '/home/your-username/perl5' ;   # this example works for Unix or Mac


# If you're running CGIProxy such that the Web server that the user sees is different
#   from the Web server CGIProxy is running on (though maybe on the same machine),
#   the SERVER_PORT environment variable might not be set to the port that the
#   user is connecting to, and so all the generated URLs will have the wrong
#   port in them.  In this case, you can set $USER_FACING_PORT to the port number
#   that *should* be in the URLs, i.e. the port that the user connects to.
# For example, this would be useful when the user connects to nginx on a server where
#   nginx then calls an internal Apache process to run this script (perhaps to take
#   advantage of mod_perl).  In such a case, the SERVER_PORT set by Apache will be
#   the port used for internal nginx-to-Apache communication, not the port the user
#   connects to nginx with.  In this case, you would set $USER_FACING_PORT to the
#   outward-facing port that nginx listens on.
#$USER_FACING_PORT= 443 ;


#---- FastCGI configuration ---------------------

# FastCGI is a mechanism that can speed up CGI-like scripts.  It's purely
#   optional and requires some web server configuration as well, and if you

# FastCGI uses a local Internet socket to communicate between the FastCGI client
#   (e.g. the web server software) and the FastCGI server (e.g. a CGI script that
#   has been converted to run as a listening daemon, such as CGIProxy).
# Set this to a port number for this script to listen on as a FastCGI script.
#   You'll need to set it in your HTTP server's configuration file too (e.g. in
#   httpd.conf or nginx.conf).  For details of that, see
#   http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/install.html#fastcgi
# This used to use a "Unix-domain socket" instead of an Internet socket, but
#   there was trouble with the FCGI module and Unix-domain sockets, so as of
#   CGIProxy 2.1.14 we use an Internet socket.
# Note that this no longer requires a ":" at the start, though that is allowed.
$FCGI_SOCKET= 8002 ;


# FastCGI uses multiple processes to listen on its socket, where each
#   process can handle one request at a time.  This is a performance tuning
#   parameter, so the optimal number depends on your server environment
#   (hardware and software).
# If you don't understand this, the default should be fine.  You can experiment
#   with different numbers if performance is an issue.
# This can be overridden with the "-n" command-line parameter.
$FCGI_NUM_PROCESSES= 100 ;


# As a FastCGI process gets used for many requests, it slowly takes more and
#   more memory, due to the copy-on-write behavior of forked processes.  Thus,
#   it's cleaner if you kill a process and restart a fresh one after it handles
#   some number of requests.  This is a performance tuning parameter, so the
#   optimal number depends on your server environment (hardware and software).
# If you don't understand this, the default should be fine.  You can experiment

# For the embedded server, you need to a) put a certificate and private key,

#   a public key.)
# You can either pay a certificate authority for a key pair, or you can

#---- Database configuration --------------------

# Database use is optional, and if you don't use one you can ignore this
#   section.  But if you're getting "Bad Request" errors, you can fix it
#   by using a database; also, see the $USE_DB_FOR_COOKIES option below.

# Database use is optional.  It's most efficient when this script is running
#   under mod_perl or FastCGI.
# The easiest database to use is SQLite.  While normal database engines like
#   MySQL/MariaDB or Oracle require a constantly running process and some
#   configuration by the system administrator, SQLite requires none of this--
#   it reads and writes directly to database files in your own directory, as
#   protected by the operating system permissions.  Because of its ease of
#   configuration, SQLite is the default database here.
# If you're using a database other than SQLite, create a database user account
#   for this program to use, or ask your database administrator to do it.  Set
#   $DB_USER and $DB_PASS to the username and password, below.  This program
#   will try to create the required database, named $DB_NAME as set below, but
#   if your DBA isn't willing to grant the permission to create databases to
#   the CGIProxy user, then you or the DBA will need to create the database.
#   This can be done with the SQL command "CREATE DATABASE cgiproxy;" (or
#   whatever you set $DB_NAME to below).
#
# If you are using a database of any kind, it must be purged periodically.  In
#   Unix or Mac, do this with a cron job.  In Windows, use the Task Scheduler.
# In Unix or Mac, the command to purge the database is
#   "/path/to/script/nph-proxy.cgi purge-db".  (Replace "/path/to/script/"
#   with the actual path to the script.)  Edit your crontab with "crontab -e",
#   and add a line like:
#     "0 * * * * /path/to/script/nph-proxy.cgi purge-db" (without quotes)
#   to purge the database at the top of every hour, or:
#     "0 2 * * * /path/to/script/nph-proxy.cgi purge-db" (without quotes)
#   to purge it every night at 2:00am.


# This is the name of the "database driver" for the database software you're using.
#   Currently supported values are "SQLite", "MySQL" and "Oracle".
# The default of "SQLite" is the easiest to use.  SQLite lets you have database
#   functionality by directly reading and writing a database file, without requiring
#   a full database engine like MySQL/MariaDB or Oracle to run on your server.
# Note that it is potentially insecure to use a database if there are other
#   untrusted people with accounts on the same server, especially if they can read
#   this script file and the database password below.  The easiest way to securely
#   use a database is to have your own server with no untrusted user having shell
#   access on it.  If this isn't practical, then you need to set file permissions
#   appropriately on both this script file and any SQLite database file:  set
#   permissions (and file ownership and group ownership) on both files to be
#   accessible by the web server's userID, but not accessible by anyone else on
#   the same server.  Note that running this on a virtual private server isn't
#   insecure in this way-- even though a VPS is a shared machine, other people
#   can't see your files (except the sysadmin).
# Set this to "" or comment it out to not use a database.  Note that you will
#   probably see "Bad Request" errors when you accumulate too many cookies; using
#   a database solves this problem, or you can periodically clear your cookies.
$DB_DRIVER= 'SQLite' ;


# If your database (other than SQLite) is running on a remote server, or on a
#   non-default port, set this to "dbserver:port", where dbserver is the name
#   or IP address of your database server, and port is the port it is listening
#   on.  If dbserver is empty (as in ":port"), then it defaults to localhost;
#   if port is empty (as in "dbserver:" or just "dbserver"), then it defaults
#   to 3306 for MySQL, or 1521 for Oracle.
#$DB_SERVER= "localhost:3306" ;


# CGIProxy creates (if possible) and uses its own database.  If you want to name
#   the database something else, change this value.  If you need a database
#   administrator to create the database, tell him or her this database name.
# This value must only contain letters, numbers, and the "_" character.
$DB_NAME= 'cgiproxy' ;

#       marks them as such, so a malicious server could get around this, but
#       then the browser probably wouldn't execute the script).
#   . remove Link: headers that link to a resource of a script MIME type.
# Within HTML resources:
#   . remove <script>...</script> .
#   . remove intrinsic event attributes from tags, i.e. attributes whose names
#       begin with "on".
#   . remove <style>...</style> where "type" attribute is a script MIME type.
#   . remove various HTML tags that appear to link to a script MIME type.
#   . remove script macros (aka Netscape-specific "JavaScript entities"),
#       i.e. any attributes containing the string "&{" .
#   . remove "JavaScript conditional comments".
#   . remove MSIE-specific "dynamic properties".
# To allow scripts from some sites but not from others, set this to 0 and

# If you want to encode the URLs of visited pages so that they don't show
#   up within the full URL in your browser bar, then use proxy_encode() and
#   proxy_decode().  These are Perl routines that transform the way the
#   destination URL is included in the full URL.  You can either use
#   some combination of the example encodings below, or you can program your
#   own routines.  The encoded form of URLs should only contain characters
#   that are legal in PATH_INFO.  This varies by server, but using only
#   printable chars and no "?" or "#" works on most servers.  Don't let
#   PATH_INFO contain the strings "./", "/.", "../", or "/..", or else it
#   may get compressed like a pathname somewhere.  Try not to make the
#   resulting string too long, either.
# Of course, proxy_decode() must exactly undo whatever proxy_encode() does.
# Make proxy_encode() as fast as possible-- it's a bottleneck for the whole
#   program.  The speed of proxy_decode() is not as important.
# If you're not a Perl programmer, you can use the example encodings that are
#   commented out, i.e. the lines beginning with "#".  To use them, merely
#   uncomment them, i.e. remove the "#" at the start of the line.  If you
#   uncomment a line in proxy_encode(), you MUST uncomment the corresponding
#   line in proxy_decode() (note that "corresponding lines" in
#   proxy_decode() are in reverse order of those in proxy_encode()).  You
#   can use one, two, or all three encodings at the same time, as long as
#   the correct lines are uncommented.
# Starting in version 2.1beta9, don't call these functions directly.  Rather,
#   call wrap_proxy_encode() and wrap_proxy_decode() instead, which handle
#   certain details that you shouldn't have to worry about in these functions.
# IMPORTANT: If you modify these routines, and if $PROXIFY_SCRIPTS is set
#   below (on by default), then you MUST modify $ENCODE_DECODE_BLOCK_IN_JS
#   below!!  (You'll need to write corresponding routines in JavaScript to do
#   the same as these routines in Perl, used when proxifying JavaScript.)
# Because of the simplified absolute URL resolution in full_url(), there may
#   be ".." segments in the default encoding here, notably in the first path
#   segment.  Normally, that's just an HTML mistake, but please tell me if
#   you see any privacy exploit with it.
# Note that a few sites have embedded applications (like applets or Shockwave)
#   that expect to access URLs relative to the page's URL.  This means they
#   may not work if the encoded target URL can't be treated like a base URL,
#   e.g. that it can't be appended with something like "../data/foo.data"
#   to get that expected data file.  In such cases, the default encoding below
#   should let these sites work fine, as should any other encoding that can
#   support URLs relative to it.

# Encode cookies before they're sent back to the user.
# The return value must only contain characters that are legal in cookie

#   or white space.
# cookie_encode() is called twice for each cookie: once to encode the cookie
#   name, and once to encode the cookie value.  The two are then joined with
#   "=" and sent to the user.
# cookie_decode() must exactly undo whatever cookie_encode() does.
# Also, cookie_encode() must always encode a given input string into the
#   same output string.  This is because browsers need the cookie name to
#   identify and manage a cookie, so the name must be consistent.
# This is not a bottleneck like proxy_encode() is, so speed is not critical.

# If $PROXIFY_SCRIPTS is true, and if you modify the routines above that
#   encode cookies and URLs, then you need to modify $ENCODE_DECODE_BLOCK_IN_JS
#   here.  Explanation:  When proxifying JavaScript, a library of JavaScript
#   functions is used.  In that library are a few JavaScript routines that do
#   the same as their Perl counterparts in this script.  Four of those routines
#   are proxy_encode(), proxy_decode(), cookie_encode(), and cookie_decode().
#   Thus, unfortunately, when you write your own versions of those Perl routines
#   (or modify what's already there), you also need to write (or modify) these
#   corresponding JavaScript routines to do the same thing.  Put the routines in
#   this long variable $ENCODE_DECODE_BLOCK_IN_JS, and it will be included in
#   the JavaScript library when needed.  Prefix the function names with
#   "_proxy_jslib_", as below.
# The commented examples in the JavaScript routines below correspond exactly to
#   the commented examples in the Perl routines above.  Thus, if you modify the
#   Perl routines by merely uncommenting the examples, you can do the same in
#   these JavaScript routines.  (JavaScript comments begin with "//".)
# [If you don't know Perl:  Note that everything up until the line "EOB" is one
#   long string value, called a "here document".  $ENCODE_DECODE_BLOCK_IN_JS is
#   set to the whole thing.]

# These are each a list of Perl 5 regular expressions (aka patterns or

#   match *every* host ending in something, leave out the "^".  For example,
#   '\.example\.com$' matches every host ending in ".example.com".  For more
#   details about Perl regular expressions, see the Perl documentation.  (They
#   may seem cryptic at first, but they're very powerful once you know how to

# NOTE:  Any HTML you insert should not have relative URLs in it!  The problem

# Sometimes you can use the same proxy (like Squid) for both SSL and normal
#   HTTP, in which case $HTTP_PROXY and $SSL_PROXY will be the same.

# This is one way to handle pages that don't work well, by redirecting to other working
#   versions of the pages (for example, to a mobile version or another version that
#   doesn't have much JavaScript).  How it works:  If the current domain matches one
#   of the keys of %REDIRECTS, then s/// (string substitution) is done on the URL,
#   using the match and replacement patterns in the 2-element value array.
# The set of sites handled this way is Facebook and Gmail, since they doesn't
#   always work well, or are slow, through CGIProxy.  If you want to access
#   them normally, then comment out or remove the line(s) below for that site.
# If you want to redirect more sites, you can add records to the %REDIRECTS
#   hash in the following way:  Set the hash key to the name of the server you
#   want to redirect, and the value to a reference to a 2-element array containing
#   the left and right sides of an s/// string substitution.  If that doesn't make
#   sense, then try to emulate an example below.
# As of version 2.1.7, the full facebook.com site works pretty well, so the
#   redirection below has been commented out.
# ... aaaand, as of version 2.1.8, the full Gmail site works pretty well, so the
#   redirection below has been commented out.
# To improve performance with facebook or other JS-busy sites, users can:
#     - close other browser windows
#     - end other CPU-heavy processes on their browsing machine
#     - reload the page or restart the browser when it gets too slow
#     - use a browser other than MSIE (it has the most problems)
#   If Gmail or facebook is still too slow or crashes a lot, you can remove the
#   leading "#" on the appropriate lines below to automatically redirect to
#   Gmail's HTML-only site or facebook's mobile site, which may work better.
%REDIRECTS= (
#    'www.facebook.com' => [qr#^https?://www\.facebook\.com#i, 'https://m.facebook.com'],

) ;


# Some JavaScript-busy sites crash when visiting them through CGIProxy.  Increasing
#   the delay times in Window.setTimeout() and Window.setInterval() makes them not
#   crash as much, but it also makes certain page actions slower.  You can set

#   functions on those sites will have their delays multiplied by that amount.  For
#   example, pages on www.facebook.com will have their delay times multiplied by 10
#   by default.
# Any sites not listed here will not have their delay times changed.

# Here's an experimental feature that may or may not be useful.  It's trivial
#   to add, so I added it.  It was inspired in part by Mike Reiter's and Avi
#   Rubin's "Crowds", at http://www.research.att.com/projects/crowds/ .
#   Let me know if you find a use for it.
# The idea is that you have a number of mutually-trusting, cooperating
#   proxies that you list in @PROXY_GROUP().  If that is set, then instead
#   of rerouting all URLs back through this proxy, the script will choose
#   one of these proxies at random to reroute all URLs through, for each
#   run.  This could be used to balance the load among several proxies, for
#   example.  Under certain conditions it could conceivably help privacy by
#   making it harder to track a user's session, but under certain other
#   conditions it could make it easier, depending on how many people,
#   proxies, and proxy servers are involved.  For each page, both its
#   included images and followed links will go through the same proxy, so a
#   clever target server could determine which proxy servers are in each
#   group.
# proxy_encode() and proxy_decode() must be the same for all proxies in the
#   group.  Same goes for pack_flags() and unpack_flags() if you modified them,
#   and probably certain other routines and configuration options.
# Cookies and Basic authentication can't be supported with this, sorry, since
#   cookies can only be sent back to the proxy that created them.
# Set this to a list of absolute URLs of proxies, ending with "nph-proxy.cgi"
#   (or whatever you named the script).  Be sure to include the URL of this
#   proxy, or it will never redirect back through here.  Each proxy in the
#   group should have the same @PROXY_GROUP.
# Alternately, you could set each proxy's @PROXY_GROUP differently for more
#   creative configuration, such as to balance the load unevenly, or to send
#   users through a "round-robin" cycle of proxies.

#@PROXY_GROUP= ('http://www.example.com/~grommit/proxy/nph-proxy.cgi',

# Normally, your browser stores all pages you download in your computer's
#   hard drive and memory, in the "cache".  This saves a lot of time and
#   bandwidth the next time you view the page (especially with images, which
#   are bigger and may be shared among several pages).  However, in some
#   situations you may not want the pages you've visited to be stored.  If
#   $MINIMIZE_CACHING is set, then this proxy will try its best to prevent any
#   caching of anything retrieved through it.
# NOTE:  This cannot guarantee that no caching will happen.  All we can do is
#   instruct the browser not to cache anything.  A faulty or malicious browser
#   could cache things anyway if it chose to.
# NOTE:  This has nothing to do with your browser's "history list", which may
#   also store a list of URLs you've visited.
# NOTE:  If you use this, you will use a lot more bandwidth than without it,
#   and pages will seemingly load slower, because if a browser can't cache
#   anything locally then it has to load everything across the network every
#   time it needs something.

# Normally, each cookie includes an expiration time/date, and the cookie stays
#   in effect until then, even after you exit your browser and restart it
#   (which normally means the cookie is stored on the hard drive).  Any cookie
#   that has no explicit expiration date is a "session cookie", and stays in
#   effect only as long as the browser is running, and presumably is forgotten
#   after that.  If you set $SESSION_COOKIES_ONLY=1, then *all* cookies that
#   pass through this proxy will be changed to session cookies.  This is useful
#   at a public terminal, or wherever you don't want your cookies to remain
#   after you exit the browser.
# NOTE:  The clock on the server where this runs must be correct for this
#   option to work right!  It doesn't have to be exact, but don't have it off
#   by hours or anything like that.  The problem is that we must not alter any
#   cookies set to expire in the past, because that's how sites delete cookies.
#   If a cookie is being deleted, we DON'T want to turn it into a session

#   cookie specification from Netscape.  Unfortunately, most browsers seem
#   to ignore the spec and instead give cookies a default path of "/", i.e.

# When handling HTML resources, CGIProxy downloads the entire resource before
#   modifying it and returning it to the client.  However, some operations
#   (such as time-intensive queries) return the first part of a page while
#   still generating the last part.  On such pages, the user might like to
#   see that first part without waiting for the entire response, which they
#   would normally have to do when using CGIProxy.  So, if this option is set,
#   then CGIProxy will return proxified HTML parts as soon as it receives them
#   from the server.  This is less efficient; for example, it means that every
#   page will have the JavaScript library inserted, even if it's not needed
#   (though that wouldn't be too bad since the library is normally cached
#   anyway).  So, we want to do this only for certain pages and not for all.
#   Thus, set this to a list of patterns that match URLs you want to handle
#   this way.  The patterns work like @ALLOWED_SERVERS and @BANNED_SERVERS
#   above, in that they're lists of Perl 5 regular expressions.  See the
#   comments there for details.
# The sample webfeat.org pattern is appropriate for libraries who use the

# Normally, if a user tries to access a banned server or use an unsupported
#   scheme (protocol), this script will alert the user with a warning page, and
#   either allow the user to click through to the URL unprotected (i.e. without
#   using the proxy), or ban access altogether.  However, in some VPN-like
#   installations, it may more desirable to let users follow links from
#   protected pages (e.g. within an intranet) that lead to unprotected,
#   unproxified pages (e.g. pages outside of the intranet), with no breaks in
#   the browsing experience.  (This example assumes the proxy owner intends it
#   to be used for browsing only the intranet and not the Internet at large.)
#   Set $QUIETLY_EXIT_PROXY_SESSION to skip any warning message and let the
#   user surf directly to unproxified pages from proxified pages.  Note that
#   this somewhat changes the meaning of @ALLOWED_SERVERS and @BANNED_SERVERS--
#   they're not allowed or banned per se, it's just whether this proxy is
#   willing to handle their traffic.  @BANNED_NETWORKS is unaffected, however,
#   since the IP ranges it contains often make no sense outside of the LAN.
# WARNING:  DO *NOT* SET THIS FLAG IF ANONYMITY IS IMPORTANT AT ALL!!!  IT IS
#   NOT MEANT FOR THAT KIND OF INSTALLATION.  IF THIS IS SET, THEN USERS WILL
#   SURF INTO UNPROXIFIED, UNANONYMIZED PAGES WITH NO WARNING, AND THEIR

# NOTE:  This is not the only difference between an NPH and a non-NPH

#   between the two types of responses.  This hack is only an approximation
#   that we hope works most of the time.  It's better to install the script

#
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These were notes to myself from testing the speed of different methods.
#   Names like "nph-proxy2" refer to different modifications.  This version,
#   the fastest, was called nph-proxy2b.
#
# If YOU figure out a faster method, please tell me about it!
#
# It would certainly be faster if rewritten in C, because you could very
#   quickly read each character from the input and write it to the output,
#   maintaining state and altering the data stream as needed.  How much
#   faster is unclear, since the regular expression governing the main
#   while() loop below (as of version 2.0) is fairly efficient, and is
#   in effect handled in C by the Perl interpreter.
#
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# [This version is nph-proxy2b:  Break into @body array, do not use
#   %urlsin to test if tags should be updated, replacement strings
#   use (a|b|c) syntax.]
#
# [%urlsin was an associative array that listed tags and attributes that
#   may contain URLs, declared like:
#  %urlsin= ('a', 'href',
#            'applet', 'codebase',
#            'fig', 'src|imagemap',
#            'form', 'action|script',  ...
#           ) ;
# ]
#
# This is by far the most time-consuming part of the script, the updating
#   of all URLs in an HTML file.
#
# Results of informal speed testing (not what I expected):
#   Breaking into @body array instead of one big string definitely saves
#       significant time-- compare nph-proxy2 to nph-proxy1.  One test
#       showed a time saving of 1/3 to 1/2.
#   Using a %urlsin array does NOT seem to save time, even when only used
#       as boolean test to see if tag might contain URL-- compare nph-proxy2
#       to nph-proxy3, nph-proxy4, and (most similar) nph-proxy5.  Oh well.
#   It seems that reading one tag at a time, converting, and sending it
#       through does NOT save elapsed time over reading all tags before
#       converting, like I thought it would.  Both the CPU and elapsed
#       time are longer for one-tag-at-a-time approach-- compare
#       nph-proxy2 and nph-piper2.
#
#   Results of nph-proxy2 (blocks for each tag) to nph-proxy2b
#   (single "(att1|att2|att3)" style regex) testing:
#       Mixed results, but overall, using a single regex (nph-proxy2b)
#       takes less CPU "user time", about the same "system time", and
#       slightly more elapsed time than nph-proxy2; I don't know why.
#       The elapsed time is slightly more both within the script and at
#       the HTTP client's end.  All differences are less than 10% on
#       average, and nph-proxy2b occasionally shows LESS elapsed time
#       than nph-proxy2.  CPU time is always less for nph-proxy2b than
#       for nph-proxy2.
#   Since the bottleneck of CPU time is tighter than for elapsed time,
#       and since the elapsed-time loss is less than the CPU time gain,
#       let's go with nph-proxy2b (not that it really makes much difference).
#       Besides, the code is easier to read that way.
#
# So basically, breaking into @body array helps, but not much else does.
#
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 8-4-98 JSM: Found a bug in the regex, so changed it.  It more resembles
#   nph-proxy2.cgi now.

# This routine proxifies an entire block of HTML, which may in turn contain
#   scripts, stylesheets, comments, etc. that need to be proxified in their
#   own ways.
# The first parameter is either a scalar to be proxified, a reference to a
#   scalar (fastest for long strings), or a reference to a list of scalars
#   that need to be joined before proxifying.  The second parameter is a
#   flag that indicates whether this is a full page being proxified, or just
#   an HTML fragment (mostly to know whether we can insert something or not).
# The return value is one long scalar, the proxified HTML.
# This routine normally exits immediately if it finds a <frameset> tag.  This is
#   usually appropriate, but it can be avoided by setting the third parameter,
#   such as when calling this from inside a (normal, non-conditional) comment.
#   This flag should be preserved in nested calls when needed.  Rarely relevant.
# Note that since this routine calls full_url(), $url_start and the $base_ vars
#   must be set before calling this.
# NOTE: IF YOU MODIFY THIS ROUTINE, then be sure to review and possibly
#   modify the corresponding routine _proxy_jslib_proxify_html() in the
#   JavaScript library, far below in the routine return_jslib().  It is
#   a (highly abbreviated) Perl-to-JavaScript translation of this routine.
#   Also note that parts of this routine are represented by other JavaScript
#   subroutines, namely _proxy_jslib_proxify_comment(),
#   _proxy_jslib_proxify_script_block(), _proxy_jslib_proxify_style_block()
#   _proxy_jslib_proxify_decl_bang(), _proxy_jslib_proxify_decl_question(), and

    # Iterate through $body, matching "chunks" as appropriate.  In HTML, the
    #   only sections that are interpreted as other than HTML are comments,
    #   within <script> blocks, within <style> blocks, and SGML declarations.
    #   Thus, match comments, <script> blocks, <style> blocks, and SGML
    #   declarations before matching any simple HTML tag.
    # Note that in a regex, alternatives are matched in order, which we take
    #   advantage of here-- the general case of a tag is matched after all
    #   others.
    # HTML outside of tags isn't supposed to have "<", but browsers support it
    #   as a literal string if it's not followed by [a-zA-Z/].  So we support that
    #   in the first line of the regex, or else it's a privacy hole.
    # Comment formats have an unfortunate history.  Technically they're
    #   supposed to end on "--\s*>" (actually it's a bit more complicated than
    #   that), but many HTML authors merely end them on ">".  Browsers seem to
    #   first try to end a comment on "--\s*>", but if that's not available
    #   they end a comment on the first ">".  In addition, some browsers don't
    #   allow whitespace between "--" and ">".  Put that together and it's not
    #   easy to know where a browser will end comment processing and restart
    #   HTML processing.  In general, it's usually safer here to treat comment
    #   as HTML than HTML as comment, so here we end comments as early as the
    #   browser might end them: if a future "-->" exists, then that means end
    #   on "--\s*>", but if a future "-->" doesn't exist, then it means end on
    #   ">".  Thus the zero-width lookahead assertions in the regex below.  Not
    #   perfect.  :P  Would be better to tailor actions to browser types.  We
    #   could err towards longer comments for safety rather than shorter, if we
    #   removed comments entirely.
    # For info about non-HTML blocks in an HTML document, see
    #   http://www.w3.org/TR/html40/appendix/notes.html#h-B.3.2
    # Script and style blocks are supposed to end with the first "</" string,
    #   but in fact browsers seem to end those blocks at the actual </script>
    #   or </style> tags.  This is most likely what the HTML author expects
    #   anyway, though it violates the HTML spec.  In this script, we should
    #   over-proxify rather than under-proxify, so we'll end those blocks on
    #   those end tags as browsers (erroneously) do.
    # Worse, Konqueror allows the string "</script>" inside JS literal strings,
    #   i.e. doesn't end the script block on them.  Netscape does end the block
    #   there, and both browsers end style blocks on embedded </style> strings.
    # Because it's a given that we can't anonymize scripts completely, but
    #   we do want to anonymize HTML completely, we'd rather accidentally
    #   treat script content as HTML than the other way around.  So err on
    #   ending the <script> block too soon for some browsers, i.e. end on
    #   the first "</script>" regardless of whether it's in a string.
    #   (We'd end on "</", but *no* browser seems to do that.)
    # Script content can can exist in:  <script> blocks, conditional comments,
    #   intrinsic event attributes ("on___" attributes), script macros, and
    #   the MSIE-specific "dynamic properties".  These can be removed or
    #   proxified, depending on the settings of $scripts_are_banned_here and
    #   $PROXIFY_SCRIPTS.
    # Script content can also exist elsewhere when its MIME type is explicitly
    #   given (for example, in a <style> block); these cases will be handled
    #   (i.e. removed, proxified, or neither) when proxify_block() is called
    #   with those MIME types.

	    # Now, proxify the tag and its attributes based on which tag it is.

	    #   URL-type attributes defined in HTML 4.0 (as of 7-31-98), an
	    #   earlier HTML DTD as of 9-17-96, and any tags documented on
	    #   Michael Hannah's comprehensive HTML reference (as of 9-17-96;
	    #   Sandia has since forced him to remove the page).  The latter
	    #   included non-standard tags found to be used by Netscape or
	    #   Microsoft.
	    # If anyone knows of a well-maintained list of standard and
	    #   non-standard tags/attributes with URLs in them, please let me
	    #   know!!
	    # Tags are roughly in order from most-common to least common, for
	    #   speed.  Beyond that, they're roughly alphabetical.  Also,
	    #   they're roughly grouped as appropriate.  In the future, they
	    #   may be called instead via a hash of function references
	    #   (e.g. "&$do_tag{$tag_name}"), if we determine that the hash
	    #   lookup plus function call is faster than the current string
	    #   comparisons.
	    # We'll only get here for tags containing attributes.
	    # Note that most of these are very rarely used, if ever.  They're
	    #   included for safety, since we don't want an anonymous user
	    #   accidentally revealing themselves because of a non-anonymized
	    #   URL.
	    # Earlier versions of this script used a long regex to extract
	    #   and modify attributes.  Now, tags are fully parsed into
	    #   attributes, which takes a little longer but operates much more
	    #   cleanly and reliably.  The code is easier to work with too.
	    # Denoting which of these are for images/binaries might be helpful,
	    #   if we need more elaborate text-only support.

	    # Notes regarding frame support:
	    # One of the flags in PATH_INFO indicates whether the page will be
	    #   displayed in a frame, so we know whether or not we can insert a
	    #   header.  Most links keep the frame flag of their containing
	    #   page, but some links can change it-- it's set in <frame> tags,
	    #   and it's cleared in various links that exit a framed page.  For
	    #   both cases, we use the full_url_by_frame() routine instead of
	    #   full_url().  (You can think in terms of entering or leaving
	    #   "frame mode".)
	    # The links that set the frame flag are <frame> and <iframe>.  The
	    #   links that can clear it are <a>, <area>, <link>, and <form>,
	    #   when their target attribute is either "_top" or "_blank".  In
	    #   addition, the <base> tag can have a target attribute, which is
	    #   the default target for any of these tags lacking their own.  So
	    #   we maintain a variable $base_unframes that tells us whether the
	    #   current <base> target would make a link exit frames (i.e. it's
	    #   either "_top" or "_blank", or at least that's our best guess).
	    #   We check $base_unframes when handling <a>, <area>, <link>, and
	    #   <form> tags to set the frame flag correctly.
	    # Not all frame exits will be caught.  :(  This is because for any
	    #   given target attribute, we don't know whether it leads to a new
	    #   open window, or another frame in the existing window.  It could
	    #   hypothetically be fixed *somewhat* by maintaining some list of
	    #   which target names identify frames, based on the immediate
	    #   browsing history (i.e. record the frame name when a <frame> tag
	    #   is processed).  This would be rather elaborate, I think.
	    # This only matters in that if a link causes the user to leave
	    #   frames in a way we don't catch, then any HTML insertion may not
	    #   display properly.  This does NOT affect anonymity (whether the
	    #   user is still surfing through the proxy); it ONLY affects the
	    #   display of the inserted HTML.
	    # Apparently, Netscape only checks a matching prefix for _top and
	    #   _blank, i.e. "_topxx" and "_blankxx" act like _top and _blank.
	    #   MSIE works correctly.

	    # Browsers are inconsistent in whether a tag's "type" attribute
	    #   takes precedence over actual Content-Type: header, or vice
	    #   versa.  It appears that for <link> tags, the type attribute
	    #   (erroneously) always takes precedence, while for the <a> tag
	    #   the type attribute is apparently ignored.  So to be consistent
	    #   with browsers, we need to IGNORE the expected type code for
	    #   the <a> tag.  In fact, we actually remove the type attribute

	    #   For details, see
	    #     http://www.w3.org/TR/html40/struct/objects.html#edef-OBJECT
	    # The <object> tag has five attributes that may contain URLs to be
	    #   converted:  usemap, codebase, classid, data, archive.  All must
	    #   be converted to absolute URLs, because a browser probably won't
	    #   resolve relative URLs correctly through this proxy.
	    # codebase is used as the base URL for classid, data, and archive;
	    #   it defaults to normal base URI.  In addition, data uses the
	    #   MIME type in "type", and classid uses the MIME type in codetype
	    #   if available, otherwise the one in "type".  Also, all URLs have
	    #   the frame flag set, to avoid inserting a page header into any
	    #   embedded objects (it's legal to embed HTML pages using the
	    #   <object> tag).
	    # The classid attribute is special: it may be a URL, or in MSIE
	    #   it may identify an Active X control by consisting of a unique
	    #   identifier preceded by "clsid:".  For example, MSIE's
	    #   Shockwave Flash player is identified by
	    #   "D27CDB6E-AE6D-11CF-96B8-444553540000".  For each such unique
	    #   object, there are certain <param> tags defined for it.  For
	    #   example, that same ActiveX control requires a <param> tag
	    #   with a name of "movie" and a value equal to the URL where to
	    #   download that movie.  Thus, we need to proxify <param> tags
	    #   with a name of "movie", but only if they're in <object> elements
	    #   with that specific classid.  Thus, we use
	    #   $current_object_classid to keep track of which <object> element
	    #   we're in.  <param> tags are supposed to come before other
	    #   content within <object> elements, so simply remembering the
	    #   classid of the latest <object> tag is sufficient (rather than
	    #   e.g. storing a stack of classids of nested objects).
	    # Several places here, we use local copies of the $base_ vars and
	    #   $url_start to call full_url() with desired base URLs, types, etc.
	    # There are a few sites with embedded objects or applets that may not
	    #   work if the proxy_encode() routine is not the simple default.  See

# Returns the full absolute URL to query our script for the given URI
#   reference.  PATH_INFO will include the encoded absolute URL of the target,
#   but the fragment will be appended unencoded so browsers will resolve it
#   correctly.
# If $retain_query is set, then the query string is removed before proxifying,
#   then readded at the end.  This is required for e.g. Flash apps, which
#   read any query parameters into program variables, and thus the query
#   string must be retained.  The downside of this is that the query string
#   is not encoded for such URLs, possibly reducing privacy.  The "real"
#   solution might be to rewrite the Flash proxification to parse the query
#   string out of document.URL and set those program variables initially.
#   We may do this at some point.  A broader solution would be to set up
#   general handlers similar to _proxy_jslib_handle() and _proxy_jslib_assign()
#   in the SWF library, to be called instead of every getMember and setMember
#   action; maybe we can get away without doing that, since that might slow
#   down Flash apps considerably.  We'll see.
# If a "javascript:" URL is in e.g. a "src" attribute, then the result of the
#   last JS statement becomes the contents of that element.  Thus, the last
#   statement needs to be wrapped in "_proxy_jslib_proxify_html(...)".  Since
#   there may be multiple statements in the URL, separated by semicolons, we
#   need to use separate_last_js_statement().
# This is a major bottleneck for the whole program, so speed is important here.
# Note that the calculations of $url_start, $base_scheme, $base_host, 
#   $base_path, and $base_file throughout the program are an integral part of
#   this routine, placed elsewhere for speed.
# For HTTP, The URL to be encoded should include everything that is sent in
#   the request, including any query, but not any fragment.
# This only returns absolute URLs, though relative URLs would usually suffice.
#   If it matters, we could have a fullrelurl() and fullabsurl(), the latter
#   used for those HTML attributes that require an absolute URL (like <base>).
#
# The ?:?:?: statement resolves relative URLs to absolute URLs, given the
#   $base_{url,scheme,host,path} variables figured earlier.  It does it
#   simply and efficiently, and accurately enough; the full procedure is
#   described in RFC 2396 (URI syntax), section 5.2.
# RFC 2396, section 5 states that there are three types of relative URIs:
#   net_path (beginning with //, rarely used), abs_path (beginning with /),
#   and rel_path, any of which may be followed by a "?query"; the query must
#   be included in the result.  Thus, we only need to examine the start of
#   the relative URL.
# This ?:?:?: statement passes all test cases in RFC 2396 appendix C, except
#   for the following:  It does not reduce . and .. path segments (to do
#   so would take a lot more time), and it assumes $uri_ref has something
#   other than an empty fragment in it, i.e. that the URI is non-empty.
# This only works for hierarchical schemes, like HTTP or FTP.  Conceivably,
#   there's a problem if the base URL uses a non-hierarchical scheme, and
#   the document contains relative URLs.  Absolute URLs will be OK.
# Any HTML-escaping/unescaping should be done outside of this routine, since
#   it is used for any relative->absolute URL conversion, not just HTML.
# NOTE: IF YOU MODIFY THIS ROUTINE, then be sure to review and possibly
#   modify the corresponding routine _proxy_jslib_full_url() in the
#   JavaScript library, far below in the routine return_jslib().  It is

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   I took the liberty of creating a general mechanism to let this proxy do
#   whatever tricks it needs to do, via the magic URL scheme "x-proxy://".
#   It was required to support HTTP Basic Authentication, and it's useful
#   for other things too.  The mechanism uses a heirarchical URL space: a
#   function family is in the normal "hostname" location, then the functions
#   and subfunctions are where the path segments would be.  A query string
#   is allowed on the end.
#
#   Don't add functions to this that may compromise security, since anyone
#   can request a URL beginning with x-proxy://.  For that matter, malicious
#   Web pages can automatically invoke these URLs, which could be annoying
#   if e.g. they clear your cookies without warning or other acts.
#
#   Which URLs map to which functions should really be documented here.  So,
#
#     //auth/make_auth_cookie
#         receives the authorization form data, sends a formatted auth
#         cookie to the user, and redirects the user to the desired URL.
#
#     //start
#         initiates a browsing session.
#
#     //cookies/clear
#         clears all of a user's cookies.
#
#     //cookies/manage
#         present the user with a page to manage her/his cookies
#
#     //cookies/update
#         process whatever actions are requested from the //cookies/manage
#         page (currently only deletion of cookies).
#
#     //cookies/set-cookie
#         set the cookie from the query string
#
#     //frames/topframe
#         returns the special top frame with the entry form and/or the
#         other insertion.
#
#     //frames/framethis
#         given a URL, returns a page that frames that URL in the lower
#         frame with the top frame above (not currently used).
#
#     //scripts/jslib
#         returns the JavaScript library used when rewriting JavaScript.
#         Normally, this can be cached for efficiency.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#    Cookie routines
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# As of version 1.3, cookies are now a general mechanism for sending various
#   data to the proxy.  So far that's only authentication info and actual
#   cookies, but more functions could be added.  The new scheme essentially
#   divides up the cookie name space to accommodate many categories.
# Explanation: Normally, a cookie is uniquely identified ("keyed") by the
#   domain, path, and name, but for us the domain and path will always be
#   that of the proxy script, so we need to embed all "key" information into
#   the cookie's name.  Here, the general format for a cookie's name is
#   several fields, joined by ";".  The first field is always a cookie type
#   identifier, like "AUTH" or "COOKIE", and the remaining fields vary
#   according to cookie type.  This compound string is then URL-encoded as
#   necessary (cookie names and values can't contain semicolons, commas, or
#   white space).  The cookie's value contains whatever you need to store,
#   also URL-encoded as necessary.

# A general bug in cookie routines-- ports are not considered, which may
#   matter for both AUTH and COOKIE cookies.  It only matters when two ports
#   on the same server are being used.


# Returns all info we need from cookies.  Right now, that means one composite
#   cookie with all cookies that match the domain and path (and no others!),
#   and an %auth hash to look up auth info by server and realm.  Essentially,
#   this undoes the transformation done by the cookie creation routines.
# @auth is used instead of %auth for slight speedup.
# See notes where the various cookies are created for descriptions of their
#   format; currently, that's in cookie_to_client() and auth_cookie().
# NOTE: IF YOU MODIFY THIS ROUTINE, then be sure to review and possibly
#   modify the corresponding routine _proxy_jslib_cookie_from_client() in the
#   JavaScript library, far below in the routine return_jslib().  It is

# Old notes:
#
# Cookie support:  The trick is how to send a cookie back to the client that
#   it will return for appropriate hosts.  Given that the target URL may be
#   encoded, and the client can't always tell where the target URL is, the
#   only way to do that is to get *all* the cookies from the client and send
#   along the matching ones.  If the client has a lot of cookies through the
#   proxy, this could conceivably be a problem.  Oh well, it works for the
#   limited amount I've tested.
# Here, we transform the cookie from the server into something the client
#   will always send back to us, and embed the real server/path info in the
#   name of the name-value pair, since the cookie is uniquely identified by
#   the domain, path, and name.  Upon return from the client, we split the
#   name back into its original fields.
# One way to get around *some* of the all-cookies-all-the-time problem,
#   *sometimes*, may be possible to program with the following approach:
#   First, the target URL must be "encoded" (in proxy_encode()) in a way
#   that it resembles a path.  For example, the default "://" --> "/"
#   encoding does this.  Then, let the cookies go back to the client with
#   the target paths still intact.  This would only work when the cookie
#   domain is the default, i.e. the source host.  Check other possibilities
#   carefully, too, but I think you could get it to work somehow.
# Question-- is the port supposed to be used in the domain field?
#   Everything here assumes not, which is conceivably a security risk.

# Transform one cookie into something the client will send back through
#   the script, but still has all the needed info.  Returns a transformed
#   cookie, or undef if the cookie is invalid (e.g. comes from
#   the wrong host).
# A cookie is uniquely identified by the domain, path, and name, so this
#   transformation embeds the path and domain info into the "name".
# If $USE_DB_FOR_COOKIES is true, then store cookie in database instead,
#   and return undef to clear any Set-Cookie: header.
# This doesn't handle multiple comma-separated cookies-- possible, but
#   which seems a slight contradiction between the HTTP spec (section 4.2
#   of both HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 specs) and the cookie spec at
#   http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html.

# This leaves the connection open, i.e. a persistent connection, because that's
#   needed for the purpose this routine was written for (the external tests).
# This routine expects a pointer to a hash containing "host", "port", "socket",
#   and "open" elements, plus a $request_uri string.  In the hash, iff "open"
#   is false, then a new socket is opened, in the interest of persistent
#   connections.  "host", "port", and "socket" (a string name of a filehandle)
#   are assumed to be unchanging.
# Note that this HTTP client is missing many features, such as proxy support,
#   SSL support, and authentication.  Eventually, http_get() may be restructured

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#  support for proxifying JavaScript
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# This routine modifies JavaScript code so that it works correctly through this
#   script.  This includes altering URL accesses to go through this script,
#   altering the reading and writing of cookies, and anthing else that's needed
#   to make script operation privacy-safe and transparent to the user.  The
#   $flush_after parameter indicates whether to insert a call to
#   _proxy_jslib_flush_write_buffers() when needed (slightly hacky).
# The return value is the proxified JS string.
# THIS ROUTINE MAY NOT BE FOOLPROOF!!!  I can say that this script proxifies
#   JavaScript better than any similar software I've seen, and I know of no
#   privacy holes, but I can't guarantee there are none at this time.  If you
#   find a way to construct JavaScript that will not be correctly proxified
#   here, then please let me know.  If extreme privacy is critical to you,
#   then I recommend you turn off scripts in your browser.
# The current approach is to replace certain constructs with calls to
#   _proxy_jslib_handle(), _proxy_jslib_assign(), or _proxy_jslib_assign_rval()
#   in the JS library.  To do this: The input is read one token at a time (see
#   the routine set_RE_JS() below for details about tokenization), and when a
#   token is found that may need proxifying, it is replaced by a call to one of
#   those three functions, depending on whether it is being read/called or
#   assigned.  This requires, during tokenization, keeping track of the current
#   "term", by which I mean what the JS spec calls LeftHandSideExpression, one
#   value or variable, like one term if you consider an expression to be like a
#   polynomial, that one term which may have several object references or
#   method calls in it.  (Harder to explain than to understand.)  The term
#   (object) leading up to the token is passed to _proxy_jslib_handle() and
#   _proxy_jslib_assign() so they can test its type and access the property
#   through it.  Also passed to _proxy_jslib_handle() are the property name
#   (either a token or read from between "[]"), and the current value of the
#   property/variable (only needed when the object is null).  Passed to
#   _proxy_jslib_assign() are the "prefix" (i.e. "++", "--", or "delete"), the
#   leading term/object, the property name, the operator that causes the
#   assignment, and the right-hand expression it's being assigned to.  If there
#   is no leading term/object, then _proxy_jslib_assign_rval() is called
#   instead, with the prefix, the property name, the operator, the expression
#   it's being assigned to, and the property's current value.
# Also done in this routine are things like incrementing subscripts of e.g.
#   document.forms[] and other arrays, and changing references from
#   "_proxy_jslib_..." to "_proxy1_jslib_..." etc. to keep the libraries
#   separate when chaining proxies.  A lot of code just deals with keeping
#   $term_so_far accurate in different situations.
# _proxy_jslib_handle() returns the same function for e.g. "a" in
#   "d.e= a" as for "a(c)", even though their "this"'s should be
#   different-- former "this" is "d", and latter "this" is "window".  This
#   is handled by testing "this===window", which should be true whenever
#   the returned function is not called as a method, including when it is
#   called immediately as in "a(c)".
#
# [Note: the next section needs to be updated, as more things need to be
#   handled than those listed below.]
#
# Below are everything in core and client-side JavaScript that need to be
#   handled, according to a read of the reference sections of "JavaScript: The
#   Definitive Guide", 4th Edition, by David Flanagan, published by O'Reilly.
#   The only exceptions are minor and would not open privacy holes, such as
#   exact screen coordinates being off because of our insertions, or certain
#   DOM arrays being shifted because of our insertions (similar to the forms[]
#   etc. arrays we try to handle, as listed below).
#
# Here are the network-related things in JS that are handled by this script:
#   Window.open(), Document.write(), Document.writeln(), Document.close(),
#     Location.replace(), Layer.load(), Window.setInterval(),
#     Window.setTimeout(), HTMLElement.setAttribute(),
#     HTMLElement.setAttributeNode(), Node.appendChild(), Node.insertBefore(),
#     Node.replaceChild, CSS*.insertRule(), HTMLElement.insertAdjacentHTML()
#     (MSIE only), Window.navigate() (MSIE only), eval(), and many others are
#     handled in _proxy_jslib_handle().
#   All setting of src, href, background, lowsrc, action, useMap, longDesc,
#     cite, codeBase, profile, cssText, nodeValue, and location properties are
#     handled in _proxy_jslib_assign().  Also handled there are any setting of
#     innerHTML, outerHTML, or outerText properties, since they are defined by
#     HTMLElement and may be inherited by many different objects.  Also handled
#     in _proxy_jslib_assign() are any setting of the various read/write
#     properties of Link and Location objects that would cause a page to load.
#     There are several other things that _proxy_jslib_assign() handles.
#   If "location" is assigned without a leading object, then it is handled by
#     _proxy_jslib_assign_rval().
#   Cookies are handled-- reading of them in _proxy_jslib_handle(), and setting
#     of them in _proxy_jslib_assign().
#   These eight array properties of the document object are incremented as
#     needed, according to what's in the insertions:  applets[], embeds[],
#     forms[], ids[], layers[], anchors[], images[], and links[].
#   (.on* events don't need changing, since they're set to a function object,
#       unlike HTML event attributes, which are set to a string containing
#       JavaScript code.)
#
# NOTE: IF YOU MODIFY THIS ROUTINE, then be sure to review and possibly
#   modify the corresponding routine _proxy_jslib_proxify_js() in the
#   JavaScript library, far below in the routine return_jslib().  It is
#   a Perl-to-JavaScript translation of this routine.

#   the "?:" characters are treated like parentheses, to handle conditional
#   expressions.  The ":" needs special treatment, because it may also be used
#   in switch statements, labelled statements, and object literals.
# In this routine, all opening parentheses "([{" are treated the same; likewise
#   for all closing parentheses ")]}".  This is a shortcut that works for all
#   valid JavaScript, but errs on e.g. "( { ) }".  A browser wouldn't run that
#   anyway, so this shortcut seems safe.

# Set the various regular expressions used in parsing JavaScript.
# These regular expressions are taken directly from the "productions" (rules of
#   grammar) of the ECMAScript specification, which is basically the JavaScript
#   spec.  The spec version followed below is the standard ECMA-262, published
#   in December 1999.  It's available at http://www.ecma.ch/ecma1/STAND/ECMA-262.HTM .
# For the most part, these patterns represent the grammar as strictly defined
#   in the ECMAScript spec.  For example, StringLiteral doesn't match '"\x"' or
#   '"\012"' and the pattern here reflects that, though other implementations
#   may be more permissive.  If needed, we can extend the patterns later to
#   cover common misuses.  Also, if we decide to support octal numeric literals
#   and octal escape sequences (as older implementations did), appendix B.1 of
#   the spec has the details.  In any case, when this program scans script
#   content and at some point fails to match a valid input element, it discards
#   the remainder of the script.  Thus, while the strictness may prevent sloppy
#   scripts from running, it gives maximum protection from privacy holes, etc.
# Some of the patterns here do not strictly follow the spec, for purposes of
#   multi-platform compatibility or performance.  To my knowledge, they work
#   fine for actual existing pages (as opposed to hypothetical cases), and they
#   do not open any privacy holes.  If you find otherwise, please let me know!
#   The various strictly conformant patterns are collected in comments at the
#   end of this routine.  Several have to do with the Unicode line terminators
#   \x{2028} and \x{2029}, which we ignore in the patterns here.
# We're not using the \x{unicode} construct, because it's not fully supported
#   yet, e.g. in character classes.
# Patterns use no-backtracking (the "(?>...)" construct) where possible for
#   speed; also, in some cases it prevents splitting tokens inappropriately.
#   No-backtracking patterns work here because the parsing and tokenizing is
#   pretty deterministic (i.e. unambiguous context of each input, which means
#   no backtracking is needed when parsing).  If we go with a more top-down
#   non-deterministic approach, we'd probably use fewer if any no-backtracking
#   patterns (though we'd still need to prevent splitting tokens).

    #  expressions
    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------

    # This section is not actually used in the program.  The "patterns" here
    #   won't quite work; they're only for studying, to work out how expressions
    #   are parsed in JavaScript.  The whole grammar of expressions is a kind of
    #   recursive network of many different productions (rules).  The set of
    #   patterns here is greatly condensed from the grammar productions in the
    #   ECMAScript spec, but is still accurate and expresses the basic
    #   framework.  One basic recursion loop is that:  Expression contains
    #   LeftHandSideExpression, which contains PrimaryExpression and Arguments,
    #   both of which may contain Expression.  If you think of Expression as
    #   being like a polynomial, then LeftHandSideExpression is similar to one
    #   term in it, and PrimaryExpression is similar to the central piece of
    #   that (e.g. a variable name, a number, or a parenthesized subexpression);
    #   Arguments is a standard comma-separated list of arguments.  This
    #   recursion loop has many more intermediate steps in the actual spec; a
    #   few that simplify the other patterns, or are referred to in their own
    #   right, are articulated below.
    # A few extra pseudo-productions are created here to simplify the rest of
    #   the grammar.  For example, the list of binary operators lets us
    #   summarize two full pages of productions into a one-line pattern.
    # Again, these are NOT actual working patterns!  So don't use them in their
    #   current state.  To make them work, the subexpressions in them that match
    #   tokens would have to be interspersed with allowed whitespace, e.g. by
    #   using $RE_JS_SKIP.  Also, regular expression literals would have to be
    #   fit in appropriately.  They're a quirk in the language definition, not
    #   used in the syntax productions-- during *parsing*, they're replaced by
    #   RegExp objects.  See the spec, section 7.8.5, for details.  Finally, any
    #   patterns that contain variables set after them must use "postponed
    #   subexpressions", i.e. the "(??{ $PATTERN })" construct.  This is how
    #   recursive (and mutually-referencing) patterns are expressed in Perl.  A
    #   pretty neat feature, actually, if you don't know about it yet.
    # If used for real, some of these patterns might benefit from being
    #   non-backtracking.  In some cases, they might even require that to parse
    #   correctly.  See notes about backtracking at the start of this routine.
    # For LeftHandSideExpression, we use a pattern that is simpler to work with
    #   than the pattern in the spec, but is not strictly accurate.  It's a
    #   superset of the real LeftHandSideExpression, so it should cover all
    #   valid JavaScript expressions.  An example of an expression that is not
    #   strictly allowed but would match our pattern is "new new foo(a).b(c)".

# Returns the JavaScript library used to proxify JavaScript.  Normally, it
#   should be cachable.
# Some of these routines (the "API") are referenced from this Perl script.
#   Other routines are added to support the API functions.
# One important routine here is _proxy_jslib_pass_vars().  It's a general
#   mechanism used to pass any needed values from the Perl script into this
#   library.  One call to it is inserted in the HTML, right after this JS
#   library is loaded.  To pass more values into this library, add arguments
#   where it is called (two places), and modify the routine itself below.
# Many routines here are analogous to Perl routines in this script.  Some are
#   almost exact translations of the Perl routines into JavaScript (thus
#   implying that whenever those Perl routines are changed, these JS routines
#   must be changed too).
# To make this code run in MSIE 5.0, we must avoid a few JavaScript features
#   that are not supported in it.  :P  These include the boolean "in" operator,
#   Array.{pop,push,shift,unshift,splice}, Function.{apply,call},
#   String.replace() with a replacement function, certain regular expression
#   constructs, and (yes) the keyword-like global property "undefined" (though
#   the value exists and can be created with "void 0").  Also, instanceof
#   doesn't always work right in MSIE so avoid that too.
# Update:  It's been a few years now that everyone has supported JS 1.5, so
#   as of 9-07 it's allowed to use some of those features above.
# Note that MSIE's Array.splice() doesn't work with one parameter, so always
#   include the second parameter when calling it.
# This library contains very little commenting, to save bandwidth.  For those
#   routines with Perl analogs, see the comments accompanying the Perl routines.

// It turns out that Array.shift() and Array.unshift() are implemented
//   inefficiently in both Firefox and MSIE, such that it seems to require
//   the whole Array to shift down in memory; thus, shifting the whole array
//   goes as O(n^2).  Additionally, Array.pop() is implemented equally
//   inefficiently in MSIE, i.e. the time for one pop() is proportional to
//   the length of the array.  Thus, this routine is written to maintain a

#   in order to proxify elsewhere correctly.  For now, only worry about type 7
#   for this, since that's how those commands are compiled to bytecode.  A
#   malicious server could use a different type to get through this and learn
#   a user's IP address.
# This routine modifies $mn_specials in place.
# Ideally we wouldn't handle "apply" and "call" when they're not methods of
#   Function, but that could be easily hidden, so we handle them all.

<p>این پراکسی در حال اجرا بر روی یک سرور ناامن است، به این معناست که بازیابی داده‌ها از یک سرور امن مجاز نیست. این خطر وجود دارد که کاربر و سرور گمان کنند که یک کانکشن امن بین این دو برقرار شده است، در حالی که در واقع ارتباط بین کاربر و این پروکسی ناامن است و شنود ممکن است رخ دهد. به همین دلیل ما یک سرور امن در نظر گرفتیم.
<p>این پراکسی بایستی بر روی یک سرور امن راه‌اندازی شود قبل از آنکه برای بازیابی صفحات در سرور امنی دیگر مجاز شود..

<h1>پروکسی نمی‌تواند از طریق خودش لوپ بک کند.</h1>
<p>آدرسی که شما در تلاش برای دسترسی به آن بوده‌اید احتمالا باعث دسترسی پروکسی به خودش شده است، که باعث اتلاف شدن منابع می‌شود. مدیر این پروکسی تنظیماتی برای ممنوع کردن اینگونه لوپ‌ها انجام داده است.
<p>به جای آنکه به پروکسی بگویید که به پروکسی برای منبع مطلوبی دسترسی پیدا کند، تلاش کنید که به پروکسی بگویید که به منبع به صورت مستقیم دسترسی پیدا کند. آدرس زیر <i>ممکن است</i> این مورد را انجام دهد.
